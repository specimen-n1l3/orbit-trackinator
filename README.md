# orbit-trackinator
this code works by inputting 3 measurements of a satellite's Ra and Dec coordinates. then the code will calculate the state vectors (radius and velocity vectors) based on the Gauss method. Then it will calculate the 6 orbital elements of the satellite. as an added feature, you can provided the TLE (two line element) of a satellite and you can generate the ground track of that satellite.
the requirements for this code are numpy, matplotlib and skyfield.
But most importantly, dont panic!
